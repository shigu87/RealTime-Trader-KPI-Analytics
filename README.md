# Trade Data Pipeline for Ecomm (Bronze-Silver-Gold Architecture)

This project demonstrates the creation and management of a **data pipeline** that processes **trade data** using a **Bronze-Silver-Gold** architecture in **Snowflake**. It simulates the flow of raw trading data from ingestion through processing to reporting, ensuring that data is transformed, aggregated, and made ready for business analysis.

The pipeline structure is based on **Futures First's** requirements for trade data analysis, involving the following stages:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion
- **Silver Layer**: Data cleaning and transformation
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregation and business reporting

## Introduction

This project involves the creation of a Snowflake-based data pipeline designed to process and aggregate trade data. The pipeline simulates **Change Data Capture (CDC)** by generating mock data, inserting it into raw tables, and processing it across multiple layers. The architecture follows a **Bronze-Silver-Gold** approach where:

- **Bronze Layer** stores raw, unprocessed data.
- **Silver Layer** performs transformations and data cleaning.
- **Gold Layer** aggregates data for reporting and business insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Snowflake**: Data warehousing platform for storing and processing the trade data.
- **Python**: Used for generating mock data and automating the data insertion process.
- **Pandas**: For manipulating and handling data in Python.
- **Snowflake Connector for Python**: Used to interact with Snowflake's database from Python.
- **SQL**: For querying, transforming, and aggregating data in Snowflake.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Mock trade data is generated and inserted into the **Bronze Layer** (raw trades).
2. **Data Transformation**: Data is cleaned and transformed in the **Silver Layer** by removing invalid records and applying business rules.
3. **Aggregation**: Data is aggregated for reporting in the **Gold Layer**, where it is summarized for trader performance and trade summaries.
4. **Business Insights**: The final aggregated data is ready for business analysis and reporting.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. **Snowflake Account**: need to have access to a Snowflake account to create databases and tables.
2. **Python 3**: This project uses Python for generating mock data and interacting with Snowflake.
3. **Required Python Libraries**:
   - `snowflake-connector-python`: Snowflake's Python connector to interact with the database.
   - `pandas`: For handling data manipulation (especially for mock data).
   - `random` and `time`: Used for generating random mock data and controlling execution timing.
4. Refer mock_data_generator.py code for mock data generation.
   **To simulate Change Data Capture (CDC), we can generate mock data for both the Bronze Layer and Silver Layer **
6. Refer snowflake_sql.sql code for the dynamic table pipeline(bronze, silver and gold) & lineage.

## Detailed Steps of the Pipeline

### 1. **Ingestion of Raw Data (Bronze Layer)**:
   - **Mock trade data** is generated using a Python script.
   - The generated data is inserted into the **bronze_trades** table in Snowflake.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation (Silver Layer)**:
   - The data from the **Bronze Layer** is cleaned. This can include:
     - Filtering out records with **invalid trade prices** or **missing data**.
   - After cleaning, the data is inserted into the **silver_trades** table for further processing.

### 3. **Aggregation and Business Reporting (Gold Layer)**:
   - The cleaned data from the **Silver Layer** is aggregated based on:
     - **Trader performance** and **trade type**.
   - The results of this aggregation are stored in:
     - **gold_trader_performance**: A table that holds performance metrics by trader.
     - **gold_trade_summary**: A table summarizing the trades by type.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. **Data Quality**:
   - Ensuring the **mock data** used for testing the pipeline was representative of **real-world data**.
   - Simulating **edge cases** in the data to make sure the pipeline handles diverse scenarios effectively.

### 2. **Latency**:
   - Generating and processing data in **near-real-time** posed challenges around:
     - Managing **Snowflake's processing capacity**.
     - Ensuring **low-latency data movement** throughout the pipeline.

### 3. **Transformation Complexity**:
   - The transformation steps for **cleaning** and **aggregating data** required a deep understanding of:
     - **Business rules** and how they should be implemented in SQL.
     - Efficiently processing and aggregating large datasets while maintaining performance.

## Real-World Usefulness

This pipeline can be applied in industries like **financial services** or **e-commerce**, where **trade data** needs to be processed and analyzed in **real-time**. It enables:

- **Fast decision-making** by providing up-to-date insights from processed data.
- **Performance tracking** to evaluate individual trader or product performance over time.
- **Reporting** based on clean, aggregated data for accurate business intelligence and analytics.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Automating Error Handling**: Implement better error-handling mechanisms to automatically retry failed operations or log issues for easier monitoring and intervention.
- **Scalability**: Enhance the pipeline to handle larger datasets efficiently, leveraging Snowflake's scaling features such as multi-cluster warehouses to ensure performance as data volume grows.
- **Advanced Data Transformations**: Introduce more sophisticated transformations, such as **anomaly detection** or **trend analysis**, to identify patterns and outliers for more advanced business insights.

---

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Logging**: Each data insertion and transformation step is logged for better traceability, ensuring that any issues can be tracked and resolved efficiently.
- **Retry Mechanism**: In case of failure, the pipeline is designed to automatically retry data operations or report issues for manual intervention, minimizing downtime and ensuring data consistency.

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Set up Snowflake**: Ensure that Snowflake is set up with the necessary databases and tables (`raw_orders`, `bronze_trades`, `silver_trades`, `gold_trader_performance`, `gold_trade_summary`).
   
2. **Run the Python Script**: Execute the Python script to continuously generate mock trade data and insert it into the `bronze_trades` table in Snowflake.

3. **Monitor the Data Flow**: Track the data as it moves through the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. Check the aggregated reports in the Gold Layer tables (`gold_trader_performance`, `gold_trade_summary`) to ensure that the pipeline is functioning correctly.
